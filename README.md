- All Azure communications use HTTPS
- File uploads are validated for size and type
- No sensitive data is logged or stored

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Azure API Connection Failed**
   - Verify your API keys and endpoints
   - Check Azure service quotas and limits
   - Ensure proper CORS configuration

2. **File Upload Issues**
   - Check file size limits (25MB for audio, 100MB for PDF files)
   - Verify supported file formats
   - Ensure stable internet connection

3. **PDF Text Extract Issues**
   - CORS errors: Ensure OCR API server allows requests from your domain
   - Network connection errors: Verify OCR API server is running and accessible
   - Check OCR API endpoint configuration in environment variables

4. **Audio/Video Playback Issues**
   - Check browser compatibility
   - Verify file format support
   - Clear browser cache

### Getting Help
- Check the Settings page for configuration status
- Use browser developer tools to debug issues
- Verify Azure service status
